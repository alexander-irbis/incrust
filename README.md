## {% Incrust %}

> Incrust is a template engine inspired by Jinja2 and written in Rust.

In fact it is a [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/), [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/templates/),
[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/), [Swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/), [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)
(and probably others) template engines constellation, which uses similar methodologies.

### Unstable

The implementation is at a very early stage and the API is a subject of changes.

__Note that Incrust currently requires the nightly version of the Rust compiler.__


## Installation

Incrust is [available on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/incrust) and can be included in your Cargo enabled project like this:

```toml
